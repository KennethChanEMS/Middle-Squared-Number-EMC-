Exeter Maths Certificate code for Middle Squared Number
## Description
A Middle Squared Number is one of the earilest PRNG to be made. Developed by John Von-Neumann this PRNG
will take a seed and square it use the middle sets of numbers add it to a string and repeat. But there
is a lot of exception for example if we got 100 squaring it give 10000 the middle are all 0s. also the
sqeuence repeats in its default state if a certain number becomes the seed or the number has a higher
digit than 10^n where n is the amount of numbers taken in the middle. So I modified it. Definity not 
painful.
